* History of frontend frameworks, JS and JSX
    - DHTML, and the demand for "more" from your frontends
    - Browser wars starting in 1995 between IE and Navigator continue today
    - Early frameworks MooTools (2007), and Scriptaculous (2010) all imperative, great for standardization
    - Declarative vs Imperative frameworks
        * review article on declarative vs imperative
        * with react use declarative style (don't need to tell that much information, just make changes and things happen)
    - JQuery in 2006, earliest FW for JS
        * good for getting down into the DOM, not simple or easy to work with
        * can still be used in React
    - AngularJS in 2009, good but huge
    - 2010 Backbone, better but still lacked patterns
    - Along comes React, Angular 2+ and Vue
        * don't put much focus into Vue is because it doesn't have perspective for clients Magenic work with. Angular and React
          are the most popular

    - Command line app releae by the FB support team to get apps up quick
    - look at links for setting up Sass, Typescript and Explore beyond
